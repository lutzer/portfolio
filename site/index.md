# Hej, my Name is Lutz Reiter

I am a Berlin based creative technologist, coder and creator of curious things. I like to create both, the useful and the seemingly useless things. I like the ideation process as much as the realization and I like to create them with my hands as well as to work digitaly. I enjoy building and designing interactive art, visualisations, interfaces, tools and sounds. Check out my [recent projects](/projects) to see more of my work. 

If you want to learn more about me, listen to my music project [Ape Finger of the Stars](https://soundcloud.com/apefinger) or watch my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lutzeputze/) feed. Most of my code related projects and open source contributions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lutzer).
