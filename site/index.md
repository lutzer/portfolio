# Hej, my name is Lutz Reiter.

I am a Berlin based creative technologist, coder and creator of curious things. I like to create both, the useful and the seemingly useless things. In my works I deal with the intersection of the digital and the physical. I enjoy building and designing interactive art, visualisations, non-conventional interfaces, tools and sounds. 

Check out my <a class="page-link" href="/projects">recent projects</a> to see more of my work. If you want to learn more <a class="page-link" href="/about">about me</a>, listen to my music project [Ape Finger of the Stars](https://soundcloud.com/apefinger) or follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lutzeputze/). Many of my code related projects and open source contributions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lutzer).
