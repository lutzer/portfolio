The Offline Library utilizes the OpenWRT operating system, which runs on a small Wifi Router - the TP-Link TL-MR3020. The system is based on the Pirate Box project and works similary: The Router serves a public and open Wifi Network which opens a captive splash page on any device which will log into the network. The router is as big as a pack of cigarettes and can be powered by a usb battery pack. The Web application offers the customisation of the user interface, the upload of new content and also an admin backend to edit the submitted entries. Its interface is fully responsive and is designed to run on all major browsers and devices.
