*The Lullaby Box lets you record and allocate lullabies to the region the singing person originates from. From the outside, the box resembles a photo booth: a private space participants can enter in order to sing and record their favorite lullaby – one they remember best from their childhood.*

The Lullaby Box lets you record and allocate lullabies to the region the singing person originates from. From the outside, the box resembles a photo booth: a private space participants can enter in order to sing and record their favorite lullaby – one they remember best from their childhood. They then can assign the audio recording to a geographical place – were they grew up as child. The collection appears on a map that provides an overview regarding the origins of the participants. The songs can be listened to on the website of the lullaby box. The installation was built for the "Living Futures" conference 2015 on the occasion of celebrating 50 years of german-israelic diplomatic relations.

The visitor can enter the dome shapped Library Box and record his facourite lullaby. In the next step he/she enters the place where the lullaby was learned.
