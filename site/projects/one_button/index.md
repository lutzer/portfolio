"Mobility at the push of a button" is the vision which is conceptualized in the oneButton Prototype. The OneButton is not bigger than a regular key. It allows the users to order an autonomous vehicle to their position, visualising waiting time and availability of the service.
Once the vehicle is closing in, it allows users to localize and identify their vehicle. It also serves as an identification link to the system.

The oneButton was part of the autonmous study "Sedric", which was also developed at the Future Center Europe.
