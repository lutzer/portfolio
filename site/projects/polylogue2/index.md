*From 26 October until the end of this year’s Biennale, the Greek Pavilion hosted the interactive installation Polylogue II. The installation aimed at experimenting with the relationship between the pavilion as a place and the 137 architects in Greece, that are members of the pavilion‘s committee as a social “space”.*

Since most of the people involved in the preparation couldn’t be physically present in the pavilion, it was designed as a communication system that connects the Pavilion’s visitors with the participants back in Greece directly, serving as a “wormhole” from one space to the other.
How and what for the installation is being used as a tool is conceptually kept open, and its meaning is produced by the interactions it facilitates: it can be a blackboard, a chat room, an oracle or a Q and A interface for the various exhibits.

Upon visiting the Pavilion, people encounter three wall-mounted boxes and a keyboard terminal, with which they can post questions that appear on the screen of one of the boxes. Once the question is typed, it is sent to a custom-designed application installed on the mobile devices owned by the members of the committee in Greece, offering them the opportunity to reply for a timeframe of 10 minutes. Responses are printed immediately on a paper roll dispensed by box displaying the question that is answered. After the time is up, the question is being printed above the answers, providing an archive of the conversation – and an empty box for new ones.
