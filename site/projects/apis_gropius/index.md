*Through a sequence of three immersive, audio-visual experiences, Apis Gropius introduces viewers to a semi-fictional, eponymous bee species. Apis Gropius has been growing and pollinating behind the Gropius Bau’s historical walls ever since its World War II bombing. Before viewers’ eyes, the Gropius Bau’s architecture comes to life as we learn about bees, their forms of inventive organisation, and their essential insights on life, building and society.*

The Apis Gropius experience is built for Augmented Reality, a technology that allows it to recognise features of the space. This approach to UX and technology allows the visitor to enjoy a seamless experience and focus on the art piece. The AR visualises moving bees, hives, floral and botanical spaces, and swarms. Through them, visitors will follow the story and bee evolution, raising questions about the importance of bees to our ecosystems.
