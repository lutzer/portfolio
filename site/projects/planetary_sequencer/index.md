A demo can be found here: https://lutzer.github.io/planetary_sequencer/v2/. The demo uses Webmidi and will send notes to all connected midi devices. For using it with Ableton, the IAC Driver needs to be enabled.

Several other prototypes and the source code can be found here: https://github.com/lutzer/planetary_sequencer
