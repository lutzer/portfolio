*A circular sequencer based on gravitational fields and planetary movements. It allows to run several sequences in different orbits, which allow for different time divisions and polyrythmic patterns.*

To create a pattern, click on the cente circle to enter the edit mode. Click on one of the orbits to add, remove or edit notes. Currently each orbit spins in a pre defined time devision. The demo uses Webmidi and will send notes to all connected midi devices. For using it with Ableton, the IAC Driver needs to be enabled.
